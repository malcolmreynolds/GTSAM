/**
 * A combined factor is assembled as one block of rows for each component
 * factor.  In each row-block (factor), some of the column-blocks (variables)
 * may be empty since factors involving different sets of variables are
 * interleaved.
 *
 * VariableSlots describes the 2D block structure of the combined factor.  It
 * is essentially a map<Index, vector<size_t> >.  The Index is the real
 * variable index of the combined factor slot.  The vector<size_t> tells, for
 * each row-block (factor), which column-block (variable slot) from the
 * component factor appears in this block of the combined factor.
 *
 * As an example, if the combined factor contains variables 1, 3, and 5, then
 * "variableSlots[3][2] == 0" indicates that column-block 1 (corresponding to
 * variable index 3), row-block 2 (also meaning component factor 2), comes from
 * column-block 0 of component factor 2.
