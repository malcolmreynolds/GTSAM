/**
 * An elimination tree is a data structure used intermediately during
 * elimination.  In future versions it will be used to save work between
 * multiple eliminations.
 *
 * When a variable is eliminated, a new factor is created by combining that
 * variable's neighboring factors.  The new combined factor involves the combined
 * factors' involved variables.  When the lowest-ordered one of those variables
 * is eliminated, it consumes that combined factor.  In the elimination tree,
 * that lowest-ordered variable is the parent of the variable that was eliminated to
 * produce the combined factor.  This yields a tree in general, and not a chain
 * because of the implicit sparse structure of the resulting Bayes net.
 *
 * This structure is examined even more closely in a JunctionTree, which
 * additionally identifies cliques in the chordal Bayes net.
