  /**
   * A ClusterTree, i.e., a set of variable clusters with factors, arranged in a tree, with
   * the additional property that it represents the clique tree associated with a Bayes net.
   *
   * In GTSAM a junction tree is an intermediate data structure in multifrontal
   * variable elimination.  Each node is a cluster of factors, along with a
   * clique of variables that are eliminated all at once. In detail, every node k represents
   * a clique (maximal fully connected subset) of an associated chordal graph, such as a
   * chordal Bayes net resulting from elimination.
   *
   * The difference with the BayesTree is that a JunctionTree stores factors, whereas a
   * BayesTree stores conditionals, that are the product of eliminating the factors in the
   * corresponding JunctionTree cliques.
   *
   * The tree structure and elimination method are exactly analagous to the EliminationTree,
   * except that in the JunctionTree, at each node multiple variables are eliminated at a time.
