   * A Generic Multifrontal Solver class

   * A solver is given a factor graph at construction, and implements
   * a strategy to solve it (in this case, eliminate into a Bayes tree).
   * This generic one will create a Bayes tree when eliminate() is called.
   *
   * Takes two template arguments:
   *   FACTOR the factor type, e.g., GaussianFactor, DiscreteFactor
   *   JUNCTIONTREE annoyingly, you also have to supply a compatible JT type
   *                i.e., one templated on a factor graph with the same factors
   *                TODO: figure why this is so and possibly fix it
