 * This solver uses multifrontal elimination to solve a GaussianFactorGraph,

 * eliminated into a Bayes tree.
 *
 * The elimination ordering is "baked in" to the variable indices at this
 * stage, i.e. elimination proceeds in order from '0'.  A fill-reducing
 * ordering is computed symbolically from the NonlinearFactorGraph, on the
 * nonlinear side of gtsam.  (It is actually also possible to permute an
 * existing GaussianFactorGraph into a COLAMD ordering instead, this is done
 * when computing marginals).
 *
 * The JunctionTree recursively produces a BayesTree<GaussianConditional>,
 * on which this class calls optimize(...) to perform back-substitution.
